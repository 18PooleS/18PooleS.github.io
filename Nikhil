      <h1>To Blend, Not Contend</h1>
<pre>
There was once a man who worked so hard,
To everything would he regard,
His heart, his soul, to make it great,
His mind, his magic, he&#39d navigate.
</pre>

<pre>
But one day he lost it all,
His soul, his mind, up so tall,
Because he&#39d given it all to his work,
So much that his mind just went berserk.
</pre>

<pre>
But if he&#39d spent a little just for him,
Grief wouldn&#39t have filled him to the brim.
It would have taken him to great ends,
And work and pleasure wouldn&#39t have to contend.
</pre>
