      <h1>Dark, Light</h1>

<pre>
Dark
Light
Darker
Lighter
Opposite
Strangely
But similar
More strange
Like the world.
We see the darks
They surround us
Sad, lonely, gloomy
Oppressive, sadder
Sadder than we can be.
Negotiators of death,
The essence of scarred,
Both scarred and scared.
But maybe not as we assume.
Darks; they are in disguise
So we can&#39t mark them for what
They really are; really can be.
Making our hearts beat faster,
They can make us even more alive.
Making stars seem even brighter –
Without dark there can be no light,
Not as we see the light, not cheerful,
Not happy, not carefree, not pleasant,
Just simply… there, existing aside us.
Light outlines dark, they&#39re opposites,
But similarly, they depend on each other
Simply dependent on how we choose to look
We see them as dark, light, as darker, lighter
Or we can see them as lighter and then darker.
It is a cycle you see, and somehow it never ends
But sometimes choices are not but ours to make
They can take away the disguise which they wear
Show their true colors, but for now, they are just
Just among us: dark, light, darker, lighter it seems.
Dark, light, darker, lighter, but strangely, similar.
