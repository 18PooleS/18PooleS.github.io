      <h1>Young Bird</h1>
<pre>
Way far up in the tree,
A baby bird tries to fly free,
Its mother has left to find food,
And the baby bird has not pursued.
</pre>

<pre>
It struggles, it cries, as it tries to fly,
But afraid it is, up so high,
It flaps its wings against the wind,
But to the nest it seems to be pinned.
</pre>

<pre>
Then suddenly, with a tuft of air,
It begins to fly everywhere,
It ducks and swoops and is filled with joy,
It is as gay as a little boy.
</pre>

<pre>
And through it all, the mother observes,
She watches the bird swoop and swerve,
She is happy that the bird has learned,
But also very, very concerned.
</pre>

<pre>
Then in an instant, the bird falls,
And they both scream a frenzied call,
The mother swoops down to grab her young,
From the tree she has sprung,
</pre>

<pre>
The baby bird was filled with fear,
The fall has given it quite a scare,
But when it sees it is not alone,
Its cry takes a different tone.
</pre>

<pre>
The mother lifts the baby bird,
They embrace each other without a word,
And back up to the nest they go,
Oh ever, ever, ever so slow.
</pre>

<pre>
The mother bird has not left at all,
She has not left the baby bird standing tall,
And the baby bird has family still,
Despite its adventures through the morning chill.
</pre>

<pre>
But the bird still has not learned to fly,
The nest simply seems far too high,
The bird now is unwilling to try
To take that open stretch of sky.
</pre>

<pre>
Staying in the nest, is it afraid?
Has its ambition begun to fade?
Is it because it feels alone?
Too much responsibility for it to own?
</pre>

<pre>
Each passing day, hope is harder to find,
Its drive, its strive that fear itself binds.
The mother watches this all with a frown.
She sees that the baby bird is very much down.
</pre>

<pre>
She tries her best to lift the bird&#39s mood,
But its eagerness has been subdued.
Oh, if only the bird would give it a shot,
Push away its fear, and not be distraught.
</pre>

<pre>
But remember still, that family is there,
That there&#39s really no need to have such a scare.
As long as the mother is there to see,
The baby bird can take off from the tree.
</pre>

<pre>
And once the bird has just enough grit,
It&#39s plain that it should not quit.
Because there can be nothing quite as strong,
As perseverance all along.
</pre>
