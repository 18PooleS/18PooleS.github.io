      <h1>Shadow's Favorite Things</h1>
 
<p>     
<pre>
Nice morning runs, and smells of good food,
The crunch of a cookie, when I’m in a mood,
A chew toy with squeakers shredded to strings,
These are a few of my favorite things.
</pre>

<pre>
Brown paper bags and loving licks,
Balls and bones, and throwing of sticks,
Chasing the birds as they flutter their wings,
These are a few of my favorite things.
</pre>

<pre>
Fuzzy, warm hugs, and wet morning dew,
Summertime sleeping and chewing shoes too,
Watching grass grow as it sniffs at the spring,
These are a few of my favorite things.
</pre>

<pre>
When the treats go, and the baths come,
When I’m lonely and frown,
I simply remember my favorite things,
And then I don’t feel, so down.
