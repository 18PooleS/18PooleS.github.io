      <h1>The Dark in the Day</h1>
      <p>
        "I used to think that life was dark,
        That life was dim, that life was stark,
        But then came a light,
        That shined so bright,
        That life seemed no longer dark as night.

        I used to think that happy meant fun,
        That happy meant safe, that happy meant sun,
        That happy was good,
        And not so dark,
        That happy was a way to escape if we could.

        I used to think that freedom would come,
        That freedom would save us from the dark we succumb,
        That freedom would win,
        That freedom would bind,
        That freedom would blaze us a path we could find.

        Then the light went away,
        And happy sketched gray,
        And freedom was once again led astray.

        But life no longer seemed dark as night,;
        Life now seemed cheery and bright.;
        And now I donâ€™t think of the light led astray,;
        I think of the dark spot in the day."
