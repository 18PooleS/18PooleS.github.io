      <h1>The Dark in the Day</h1>
      <p>
        I used to think that life was dark,<br>
        That life was dim, that life was stark,<br>
        But then came a light,<br>
        That shined so bright,<br>
        That life seemed no longer dark as night.<br>

        I used to think that happy meant fun,<br>
        That happy meant safe, that happy meant sun,<br>
        That happy was good,<br>
        And not so dark,<br>
        That happy was a way to escape if we could.<br>

        I used to think that freedom would come,<br>
        That freedom would save us from the dark we succumb,<br>
        That freedom would win,<br>
        That freedom would bind,<br>
        That freedom would blaze us a path we could find.<br>

        Then the light went away,<br>
        And happy sketched gray,<br>
        And freedom was once again led astray.<br>

        But life no longer seemed dark as night,<br>
        Life now seemed cheery and bright.<br>
        And now I donâ€™t think of the light led astray,<br>
        I think of the dark spot in the sun.<br>
